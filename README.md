# OwnCloud-API-JS-TS
OwnCloud-API-JS-TS is an api wrapper for the OwnCloud api, written in Typescript. It will be packaged and released on npm later.

Currently, the only wrapper I had found was written in Python, found [here]().
For those in web development, I hope that this api wrapper will be helpful.
